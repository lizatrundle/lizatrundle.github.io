        <p className="art-description">
          Beyond my career in software development, I am deeply passionate about art in all its forms. I have been creating art for as long as I can remember, exploring everything from painting and drawing to photography, ceramics, web design, video editing, cookie and cake decorating, and even nail art. This artistic background strengthens my software development work, allowing me to blend creative vision with technical expertise. My attention to detail, creative problem-solving, and design thinking enable me to craft elegant code and beautiful user experiences.
